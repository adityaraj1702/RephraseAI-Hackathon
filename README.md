# This is the repository for the rephraseAI hackathon


### Create a `.env` file in the root directory and create a variable called `REPHRASE_API` and add your API key to the variable

### To start the server run `node index.js`
### After running the server make a POST request using a testing tool like postman and pass a body with text as key and the content in the value of text. Then the server will make API requests to the rephrase AI and it will create a video in the dashboard.
